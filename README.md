# OrnelasK_Final_Project

The purpose of this project was to 
  1. Clean Pennie Logemann's data to match the National Phenology Network's format to be uploaded to their website.      2. Use Pennie's data to investigate the relationship between First Flowering Date (FFD) and weather + time
  3. See how the results of a a smaller dataset collected in the same area as a larger dataset differ                     (Miller-Rushing and Primack 2008)  
  
* IMPORTANT * 
Within the supporting_files folder there is a file named "classification.csv". This file is very large and can not be uploaded to github. In the gitignore document I currently have this file to be ignored for upload. The code for this csv has also been commented out (line 196). Make sure to uncomment this line to have the project run properly 

Folder
clean_data - where all clean finished data will be stored
plots - where all plots will be stored 
raw_data - any raw data that is used to analyze 
supporting_files - any files that are used to help either a package run or the result from a package such as WFO.backbone, classification.csv, and corrected_taxonomy.csv

I tried asking chatgpt to help me find and error with line 176 to try and get my project to knit. I know the issue is that the get tsn function is causing the error and tried fixing it but couldn't get it. I did see your email but it was right as I went to my honors graduation and had no time to respond. I understand if I get points deducted for not turning an md file for my project.
